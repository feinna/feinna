# Hello.
My name is Jenn and I currently live in Melbourne, Australia. I am in the final year of my PhD. Some days it’s fascinating and some days I hate it.

## 🏛️ My current project: a phd thesis
I sit within the Faculty of Arts at Monash University within the School of Media, Film and Journalism. My thesis is currently titled “Making Parliament Accessible”. 

I use large language models (Llama 3.1 8B, Mistral Small 3.1 24B, and Claude 4 Opus) to write government bill explainer documents (explanatory memoranda) using the text of specific federal parliamentary bills. I am interested in finding out whether the language models are capable of writing this information to a more understandable level than what currently exists, and if so, what gets changed in the process of doing so. I use python for this project.

## 👷🏻 Personal interests
My hobbies include: reading, target archery (barebow), cycling, dancing (balboa), knitting, and playing D&D (I'm a half-orc rogue). I like to draw using my iPad and I have made art for myself and for mods of games. 

## 🔗 Links to organisations
I am an affiliate of the ARC Automated Decision Making and Society Centre (https://www.admscentre.org.au/). Here is my profile on the ADM+S website (https://www.admscentre.org.au/jenn-wilson/). I cannot speak more highly to the centre itself, the scholars within it, the professional staff, and the overwhelmingly positive engagement that comes from being a member of a research group.

If you are thinking of doing a PhD in Australia, my biggest piece of advice is to do it through a research centre if you can, and if you can’t, find out if your prospective advisors are members of a research centre that you can affiliate with. It’s well worth the conversation.
